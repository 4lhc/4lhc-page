My primary research interests lie in long-term human-robot interaction (HRI). More precisely, I would like to explore the underlying social mechanisms for long-term HRI and develop algorithms to implement these mechanisms in social robots. To that end, I envision a complementary union of model-based and data-driven HRI approaches. In addition, I intend to concentrate on deploying social robots in domains where long-term HRI can be beneficial. I strive to gain deeper insights to make both technically and socially relevant contributions towards building social robots.
